Inspiration
We got our inspiration from our experiences during our fall semester. We also got our inspiration from our dear friend, who was struggling to keep track of her assignments and was struggling both academically and mentally especially being a college student who is far from home.

What it does
MyCollegeMate is an interactive website that helps you succeed and keep track of all your social and academic needs. It uses an Adventure type game style to motivate college students throughout the year with the use of variety and passed mask as levels.

How we built it
We planned it out using figma and then used vscode to implement our code and push our code to github.

Challenges we ran into
Challenges we ran into was making it look pretty because we don't have much experience with user UI. We also had to place our selves in the user shoes and make sure everything works well.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating an interactive website and having a website that actually works.

What we learned
We learned that it's harder to formulate an idea than actually code it. We also learned that communication is key.

What's next for My College Mate
We hope to continue to work on this and add more customization options, create more levels and implement more helpful resources for college students academically and socially.
